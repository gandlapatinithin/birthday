        <p>Dear Meghana,</p>
        <p>Happy Birthday! I couldn't be happier to celebrate your special day with you. From our B.Tech days, you've been a bright light in my life, always making me laugh and giving me the best company. Your humor and positivity are truly infectious, and whenever I'm feeling down, I can always count on you to lift my spirits. I'm so grateful for all the memories we've created together. I hope your birthday is as amazing as you are, filled with laughter, joy, and everything you love. Enjoy your day to the fullestâ€”you deserve all the happiness in the world.</p>
